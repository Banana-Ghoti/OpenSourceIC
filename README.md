# LC Circuit Design

This project demonstrates the behavior of an **LC circuit** (inductor and capacitor) and its oscillatory response.

## Description
An **LC circuit** consists of an **inductor (L)** and a **capacitor (C)** connected together. The circuit exhibits oscillations at its resonant frequency when excited by a voltage source.

## Files
- **lc_circuit.asc**: LTspice schematic file for the LC circuit.
- **lc_sim.png**: Output waveform showing the oscillations in the LC circuit.

## How to Simulate
1. Open the **lc_circuit.asc** file in LTspice.
2. Run the **Transient Analysis** to observe the oscillations in the circuit.
3. View the **lc_sim.png** image for the output waveform of the simulation.

## Notes
- The circuit demonstrates basic resonance behavior.
- Feel free to experiment with component values (L, C) to see how they affect the frequency of oscillations.
